# SolarWinds SWQL examples
A collection of SolarWinds SWQL examples

After quite a few years of SolarWinds adminstration I have collected quite a few SWQL examples, which can be used for API calls, Alerts and Reports.
I am putting them up here for other SolarWinds users to plagiarise for their own benefit.

For more information on SWQL please have a look at https://github.com/solarwinds/OrionSDK and check out https://thwack.solarwinds.com/
